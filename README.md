# VRP-cs182

:warning: **Attention** :warning:
- if you do not want something to be tracked by git, name the file / folder with **NoTrack** or **TEST** in the name.
    - e.g., do NOT add your wandb API key somewhere in the code
- git collabration on Jupyter notebook can be annoying. We suggest use Jupyter notebooks only for personal debugging purpose.


## dataset
The entire Amazon VRP dataset (3.3 GB -> 1.6 GB only keep used info) is too large to be included in this repository. We only provide a small subset under the folder `/dataset` for debugging purpose, and keep the full dataset on the server where we have access to. We also provide script to download the full dataset on your server / local machine.
